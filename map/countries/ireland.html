  The Republic of Ireland occupies most of the island of Ireland, off the coast of England
  and Wales. Its capital, Dublin, is the birthplace of writers like Oscar Wilde, and home
  of Guinness beer. The 9th-century Book of Kells and other illustrated manuscripts are on
  show in Dublin’s Trinity College Library. Dubbed the "Emerald Isle” for its lush
  landscape, the country is dotted with castles like medieval Cahir Castle.
