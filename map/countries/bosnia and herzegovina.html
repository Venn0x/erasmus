  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country on the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe. Its
  countryside is home to medieval villages, rivers and lakes, plus the craggy Dinaric
  Alps. National capital Sarajevo has a well preserved old quarter, Baščaršija, with
  landmarks like 16th-century Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque. Ottoman-era Latin Bridge is the site
  of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which ignited World War I.
