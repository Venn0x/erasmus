  Luxembourg is a small European country, surrounded by Belgium, France and Germany. Itâ€™s
  mostly rural, with dense Ardennes forest and nature parks in the north, rocky gorges of
  the Mullerthal region in the east and the Moselle river valley in the southeast. Its
  capital, Luxembourg City, is famed for its fortified medieval old town perched on sheer
  cliffs.
