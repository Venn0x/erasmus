  Georgia, a country at the intersection of Europe and Asia, is a former Soviet republic
  that’s home to Caucasus Mountain villages and Black Sea beaches. It’s famous for
  Vardzia, a sprawling cave monastery dating to the 12th century, and the ancient
  wine-growing region Kakheti. The capital, Tbilisi, is known for the diverse architecture
  and mazelike, cobblestone streets of its old town.
