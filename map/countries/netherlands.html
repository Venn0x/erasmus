  The Netherlands, a country in northwestern Europe, is known for a flat landscape of
  canals, tulip fields, windmills and cycling routes. Amsterdam, the capital, is home to
  the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum and the house where Jewish diarist Anne Frank hid
  during WWII. Canalside mansions and a trove of works from artists including Rembrandt
  and Vermeer remain from the city's 17th-century "Golden Age."
