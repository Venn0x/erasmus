  Finland is a Northern European nation bordering Sweden, Norway and Russia. Its capital,
  Helsinki, occupies a peninsula and surrounding islands in the Baltic Sea. Helsinki is
  home to the 18th-century sea fortress Suomenlinna, the fashionable Design District and
  diverse museums. The Northern Lights can be seen from the country's Arctic Lapland
  province, a vast wilderness with national parks and ski resorts.
