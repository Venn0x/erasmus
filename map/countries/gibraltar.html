  Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory and headland, on Spain's south coast. Itâ€™s
  dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, a 426m-high limestone ridge. First settled by the
  Moors in the Middle Ages and later ruled by Spain, the outpost was ceded to the British
  in 1713. Layers of fortifications include the remains of a 14th-century Moorish Castle
  and the 18th century Great Siege Tunnels, which were expanded in WWII.
