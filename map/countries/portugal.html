  Portugal is a southern European country on the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain. Its
  location on the Atlantic Ocean has influenced many aspects of its culture: salt cod and
  grilled sardines are national dishes, the Algarve's beaches are a major destination and
  much of the nation’s architecture dates to the 1500s–1800s, when Portugal had a powerful
  maritime empire.
