  Andorra is a tiny, independent principality situated between France and Spain in the
  Pyrenees mountains. Itâ€™s known for its ski resorts and a tax-haven status that
  encourages duty-free shopping. Capital Andorra la Vella has boutiques and jewelers on
  Meritxell Avenue and several shopping centers. The old quarter, Barri Antic, houses
  Romanesque Santa Coloma Church, with a circular bell tower.
