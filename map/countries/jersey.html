  Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands, between England and France. A
  self-governing dependency of the United Kingdom, with a mix of British and French
  cultures, it’s known for its beaches, cliffside walking trails, inland valleys and
  historic castles. The Jersey War Tunnels complex, in a former hospital excavated by
  slave labor, documents the island’s 5-year German occupation during WWII.
