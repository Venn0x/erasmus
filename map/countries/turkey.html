  Turkey , officially the Republic of Turkey, is a transcontinental country straddling
  Southeastern Europe and Western Asia. It borders Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest;
  the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to
  the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the
  Aegean Sea to the west. Istanbul, the largest city, is the financial centre, and Ankara
  is the capital. Turks form the vast majority of the nation's population, and Kurds are
  the largest minority.
