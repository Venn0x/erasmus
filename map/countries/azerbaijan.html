  Azerbaijan, the nation and former Soviet republic, is bounded by the Caspian Sea and
  Caucasus Mountains, which span Asia and Europe. Its capital, Baku, is famed for its
  medieval walled Inner City. Within the Inner City lies the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, a
  royal retreat dating to the 15th century, and the centuries-old stone Maiden Tower,
  which dominates the city skyline.
