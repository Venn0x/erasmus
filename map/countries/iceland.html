  Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes,
  geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and
  Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik,
  which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing
  Iceland’s Viking history.
