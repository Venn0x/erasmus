  Armenia is a nation, and former Soviet republic, in the mountainous Caucasus region
  between Asia and Europe. Among the earliest Christian civilizations, itâ€™s defined by
  religious sites including the Greco-Roman Temple of Garni and 4th-century Etchmiadzin
  Cathedral, headquarters of the Armenian Church. Khor Virap Monastery is a pilgrimage
  site near Mount Ararat, a dormant volcano just across the border in Turkey.
